<h1>Privacy Policy</h1>

<h2>Information Collection and Use</h2>

The app only displays advertisements provided by third-party services.

<h2>Third-Party Advertising</h2>

CleanWalls uses Google AdMob to display ads. AdMob may collect certain information automatically, such as device identifiers, IP address, or ad interaction data, in order to provide and improve advertising services.

This data collection is governed by Google's own Privacy Policy. We do not control or access the data collected by AdMob.

Since CleanWalls does not collect or store user data directly, no personal data is retained on our servers.
